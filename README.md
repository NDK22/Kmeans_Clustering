## Introduction

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on feature similarity. This implementation focuses on UCI datasets, providing a solution to the Initial Centroid Problem through careful initialization methods.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python installed. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python kmeans.py <data_file>
